# Task for reviewer

[Read from: /Users/drongous/workspace/experemental/FishCounter/fish_counter/plan.md, /Users/drongous/workspace/experemental/FishCounter/fish_counter/progress.md]

Final quick review after fixes for match-results-timeline. Inspect repo directly. Do NOT edit. Do NOT run subagents.

Scope: current working tree diff vs HEAD. Focus only on latest fixes:
- GameSession finalCount null preservation in JSON and tests.
- AnalyticsTimelineSection minute buckets.
Parent validation: `flutter analyze --no-pub` clean; `flutter test` all 88 passed.

Return blockers only + fixes worth doing now. Short.

## Acceptance Contract
Acceptance level: attested
Completion is not accepted from prose alone. End with a structured acceptance report.

Criteria:
- criterion-1: Return concrete findings with file paths and severity when applicable

Required evidence: review-findings, residual-risks

Finish with a fenced JSON block tagged `acceptance-report` in this shape:
Use empty arrays when no items apply; array fields contain strings unless object entries are shown.
