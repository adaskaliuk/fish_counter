# Task for reviewer

[Read from: /Users/drongous/workspace/experemental/FishCounter/fish_counter/plan.md, /Users/drongous/workspace/experemental/FishCounter/fish_counter/progress.md]

Final review loop round 1 — correctness/regressions + tests for auth-role work in latest commit.

Inspect repo directly. Do NOT edit. Do NOT run subagents.

Target: commit `5b18bee Add auth role flow` versus its parent (`git diff 5b18bee^ 5b18bee`). Ignore current uncommitted unrelated files unless they affect validation.

Focus:
- role persistence and migration safety
- AuthScreen signup/login with injected MockFirebaseAuth
- AuthGate role setup exits after save and preserves profile fields
- athlete/coach visibility correctness
- tests and validation gaps

Return: blockers only, then fixes worth doing now, then optional/defer. Short.

## Acceptance Contract
Acceptance level: reviewed
Completion is not accepted from prose alone. End with a structured acceptance report.

Criteria:
- criterion-1: Implement the requested change without widening scope
- criterion-2: Return evidence sufficient for an independent acceptance review

Required evidence: changed-files, tests-added, commands-run, validation-output, residual-risks, no-staged-files

Review gate: required by reviewer.

Finish with a fenced JSON block tagged `acceptance-report` in this shape:
Use empty arrays when no items apply; array fields contain strings unless object entries are shown.
